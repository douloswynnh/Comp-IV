The original assignemt had errors when testing with boost framework. I reworked the boost test files 
so that the code does not have any errors. I also got -1 from not including name on .tar so I also 
fixed that here. 
All 3 files FibLFSR.cpp, FibLFSR.h, test.cpp can be run with cpplint.py and result in no errors.
